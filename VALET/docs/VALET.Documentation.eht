: Documentation Guidelines

<P>
All Vapour code should be well documented. The VALET source tree is documented using CxxDoc, a basic tutorial of which
can be found <A HREF="http://ravl.sourceforge.net/doc/Auto/Basic/Tree/Ravl.Introduction.Documentation.html" TARGET=_blank">here</A>.
Our usage of CxxDoc does have some modifications, and these will be documented soon.

<P>
All source files, including README's and example must contain the the standard file header, as the copyright

The file, author, date and rcsid CxxDoc tags must also be included in every file. Forgot them at your peril!

<P CLASS="HEADING">
C++ Requirements
</P>
<P>
Classes should have a description, as should all functions. Functions should have descriptions of their parameters and return types, describing what they 
represent, and the range of vaild values if appropriate. For larger classes, functions should be divided into sensible sections.
