: Data Streaming Objects

These classes manage the streaming of the user interface bitmap and simulation data.
Unlike conventional file access, the file loading and management is performed by the ActiveX container
(i.e. Internet Explorer) and these classes are informed by the container when new data arrives.
Downloaded data is transparently streamed or copied to the user's temp directory. While you can access the
file contents much like a regular file, through MFC's CFile class functions, you have no direct knowledge
of the local file location.
