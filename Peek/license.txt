                       January 26, 1999

                   GENERAL LICENSE AGREEMENT

This document pertains to the use and distribution of the Peek Orientation
Calculator. It applies to all Peek executable (binary) files and documentation
files. All of these are referred to here as "the software".

All of this software is Copyright 1999 by Vapour Technology. Although it is 
distributed as freeware, it is NOT PUBLIC DOMAIN.

The copyrighted package may ONLY be distributed and/or modified according
to the license granted herein.


                         USAGE PROVISIONS

Permission is granted to the user to use the software and associated files.
The use of this software is completely free.


                GENERAL RULES FOR ALL DISTRIBUTION

The permission to distribute this software under certain very specific
conditions is granted in advance, provided that the following conditions
are met.

The distribution file must not be renamed or rearchived without the explicit
permission of Vapour Technology.  You may rename the file only to meet the
file name conventions of your system or to avoid file name duplications but
we ask that you try to keep file names as similar to the originals as
possible.

No portion of this package may be separated from the package and
distributed separately other than under the conditions specified in the
provisions given below. This means that the software must always be
distributed with the accompanying files intact, including this license and
the README file.

Non-commercial distribution in which no money or compensation is charged
(such as a user copying the software for a personal friend or colleague) is
permitted with no other restrictions.

Teachers and educational institutions may also distribute the material to
students and may charge minimal copying costs if the software is to be used
in a course.

The executable files in the package may not be decompiled or reverse
engineered in any way. This includes capturing of images from the
application.


       CONDITIONS FOR SHAREWARE/FREEWARE DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES

Shareware and freeware distribution companies may distribute the software
included in software-only compilations using media such as, but not limited
to, floppy disk, CD-ROM, tape backup, optical disks, hard disks, or memory
cards.  This section only applies to distributors of collected programs.
Anyone wishing to bundle the package with a shareware product must use the
commercial bundling rules.  Any bundling with books, magazines or other
print media should also use the commercial rules.

You must notify us that you are distributing this software and must provide
us with information on how to contact you should any support issues arise.


     CONDITIONS FOR ON-LINE SERVICES AND BBS'S INCLUDING INTERNET

On-line services, BBS's and internet sites may distribute the software 
under the conditions in this section.

The site may only charge standard usage rates for the downloading of this
software. A premium may not be charged for this package. I.E. CompuServe or
America On-Line may make these archives available to their users, but they
may only charge regular usage rates for the time required to download.


                   CONDITIONS FOR COMMERCIAL BUNDLING

Vendors wishing to bundle this software with commercial software (including
shareware) or with publications must first obtain explicit permission from
Vapour Technology.  This includes any commercial software or publications,
such as, but not limited to, magazines, cover-disk distribution, books,
newspapers, or newsletters in print or machine readable form.

Vapour Technology will decide if such distribution will be allowed on a
case-by-case basis and may impose certain restrictions as it sees fit.
The minimum terms are given below. Other conditions may be imposed.

	Purchasers of your product must not be led to believe that they are
	paying for this software.  Any mention of Peek on the box, in advertising
	or in instruction manuals must be clearly marked with a disclaimer that
	this is free software and can be obtained for free or nominal cost from
	various sources.

	Include clear and obvious information on how to obtain the official
	distribution.

	Include a credit page or pages in your documentation for this software.


                      RETAIL VALUE OF THIS SOFTWARE

Although the software is, when distributed within the terms of this agreement,
free of charge, the retail value (or price) of this program is determined
as GBP5.00 (Pounds Sterling) per copy distributed, copied, or used. If the 
software is distributed, copied, or used without authorisation you are legally
liable to this debt to the copyright holder or any other person or organisation
delegated by the copyright holder for the collection of this debt, and you
agree that you are legally bound by the above and will pay this debt within
30 days of the event.

However, none of the above paragraph constitutes permission for you to
distribute, copy or use this software outside of the terms of this agreement.
In particular, the conditions and debt mentioned above (whether paid or unpaid)
do not allow you to avoid statutory damages or other legal penalties and does
not constitute any agreement that would allow you to avoid such other legal
remedies as are available to the copyright holder.

Put simply, this software is only free if you comply with our conditions ; it
is not free otherwise. The copyright holder of this software chooses to give
it away free under these and only these conditions.

For the purpose of copyright regulations, the retail value of this software is
GBP5.00 (Pounds Sterling) per copy.


                           REVOCATION OF LICENSE

VIOLATION OF THIS LICENSE IS A VIOLATION OF COPYRIGHT LAWS.  IT WILL RESULT
IN REVOCATION OF ALL DISTRIBUTION PRIVILEGES AND MAY RESULT IN CIVIL OR
CRIMINAL PENALTY.

Such violators who are prohibited from distribution will be identified in
this document.
