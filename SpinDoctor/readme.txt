                               INTRODUCTION

Thanks for downloading SpinDoctor, from Vapour Technology. SpinDoctor is a 
graphics calculator that can perform a wide variety of operations on 3D
vectors, scalars and axis-angle rotations. These include simple additions and
so on, through to calculations of angles and rotations of vectors.

                               INSTALLATION

To install SpinDoctor on you system, run the executable 'spindoctor_install.exe'.
Select the directory you wish to install to, and the rest is done automatically.
Unfortunately, you have to add you own icon to the Start Menu, but such is life.


                                  USAGE

SpinDoctor is a calculator for 3D graphics calculations. A list of the 
calculations it can perform can be found below. The codes next to the 
operations show what type of data they work on.

  v = vector, s = scalar, r = rotation
  ------------------------------------
      Addition      (vv, ss, rr)
      Subtract      (vv, ss, rr)
      Multiply      (vv, ss, vs)
      Divide        (vv, ss, vs)
      Dot Product   (vv)
      Cross product (vv)
      Angle         (vv)
      Normalise     (v, r) 
      Reflect       (v)
      Length        (v)
      Convert       (s)
      (Inv)Sine     (s)
      (Inv)Cosine   (s)
      (Inv)Tangent  (s)
      Invert        (r)
      Rotate Vector (rv)

The program operates on vectors, scalars, or rotations. Vectors are 3-numbers, 
specifiying X Y and Z components. Scalars are a single number, and Rotations 
are VRML-style axis-angle rotations. The first three components define an axis 
of rotation, and the fourth defines an angle to rotate about that vector. Spin
Doctor uses a right-handed coordinate system.

The input boxes will only allow correctly formatted numbers to be entered. If
you find that the program does not let you enter something, it is probably not 
a valid number.

More information on the operations and data types can be found in the help 
system that is distributed with the program.
