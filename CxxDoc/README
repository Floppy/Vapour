#===--- Intro

This details how to build a local install of the source documentation. Scripts
check out all the required modules from cvs and build docs for all
architectures.

#===--- Requirements

To run:-
CxxDoc from Ravl/SourceTools
  available from http://ravl.sourceforge.net, but only CxxDoc binary required
cvs client apps
  available all over the shop
VALET/VMake
  download from Vapour cvs, built and in local bin path
  
To view:-
Apache server running PHP
  http://www.apache.org
  http://www.php.org
vsrcdoc_core.php
  from vapourtech.net - used for arch link generation
  
#===--- Customizing

Copy build_local_docs.sh to a temp directory into which the source can be
checked out (build procedure will leave dir as found). Edit VALET_DOCROOT and
VALET_CVSOPTIONS to suit.

Hmmmm, currently Vapour/CxxDoc/class/global.stmpl set the internal doc path to 
/internal/docs and the filesystem path to /www/vapourtech/www/internal/docs. 
If you can get your local Apache set-up to match this location (through cunning
use of symlinks) then you're laughing. Otherwise I'll have to look into a better
method (such as moving it into vsrcdoc_core.php).

#===--- Building

Now this is all done, just run ./build_local_docs.sh in your temp directory and
the whole thing should be built!
